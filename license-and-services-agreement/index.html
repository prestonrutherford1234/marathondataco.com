                <h3>11.1 Processing Terms</h3>
                <p>Marathon processes personal data only as necessary to provide the services described in this Agreement, in accordance with the Customer's documented instructions. Marathon shall not process personal data for any purpose other than as set forth herein without the prior written consent of the Customer.</p>

                <h3>11.2 California-Specific Terms (CCPA)</h3>
                <p>To the extent the California Consumer Privacy Act ("CCPA") applies, Marathon acts as a "Service Provider" as defined under the CCPA.

                <h3>11.3 Service Optimization</h3>
                <p>Marathon may use personal data in an aggregated and deidentified form to improve and optimize the services, provided such use does not identify any individual Customer or data subject. Any insights derived from such data shall be the property of Marathon.</p>

                <h3>11.4 Aggregation</h3>
                <p>Marathon may aggregate Customer data with data from other customers to create anonymized, statistical datasets. Such aggregated data shall not contain any personally identifiable information and may be used by Marathon for benchmarking, analytics, and service improvement purposes.</p>

                <h3>11.5 Information Security and Incidents</h3>
                <p>Marathon implements and maintains appropriate technical and organizational security measures designed to protect personal data against unauthorized access, alteration, disclosure, or destruction. In the event of a confirmed personal data breach, Marathon shall notify the Customer without undue delay and in no event later than 72 hours after becoming aware of the breach, providing sufficient information to enable the Customer to meet any obligations to report the breach to relevant authorities or data subjects.</p>

                <h3>11.6 Cross-Border Transfers</h3>
                <p>To the extent personal data is transferred outside the Customer's jurisdiction, Marathon ensures that appropriate safeguards are in place, including Standard Contractual Clauses approved by the European Commission or other transfer mechanisms recognized under applicable data protection laws. Marathon shall inform the Customer of any intended changes concerning the addition or replacement of sub-processors involved in cross-border transfers.</p>

                <h3>11.7 Audits and Data Deletion</h3>
                <p>Marathon shall make available to the Customer all information necessary to demonstrate compliance with this DPA and allow for and contribute to audits, including inspections, conducted by the Customer or an auditor mandated by the Customer. Upon termination of the Agreement or upon the Customer's written request, Marathon shall delete or return all personal data processed on behalf of the Customer, unless retention is required by applicable law.</p>

                <h3>11.8 Customer Obligations</h3>
                <p>The Customer represents and warrants that it has obtained all necessary consents and authorizations required under applicable data protection laws for the processing of personal data by Marathon. The Customer is responsible for ensuring the accuracy, quality, and legality of the personal data provided to Marathon and the means by which such data was acquired.</p>

                <h3>11.9 Processing Details Summary</h3>
