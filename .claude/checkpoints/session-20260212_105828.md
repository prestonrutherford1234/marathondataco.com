# Session Checkpoints — 2026-02-12

### Checkpoint 1 (25% — Quarter Session) (04:34)

[GOTCHA] Initially, the agent proposed a complex 8-phase plan involving refactoring the existing single-page HTML into separate files, creating an Express server, and porting a lead capture system, which was unnecessary. The existing site already had all features baked in.
[DECISION] The decision to revert to the existing single HTML file structure was made after the user expressed concerns about over-engineering and the desire to keep the site simple, fast, and easy to update.
[PATTERN] For simple websites, especially those with a lot of client-side interactivity, a single-page HTML structure can be sufficient and easier to maintain than a more complex, modular setup.
[GOTCHA] The agent tried to create separate directories for legal pages and a server, which were not needed as the legal pages already existed in the Growth OS site.
[CONTEXT] The brand measurement site is a single-page HTML file with features like a sticky email capture bar, Dash mascot, confetti, cursor glow, 3D card tilt, Konami code easter egg, and an AI badge, and mobile responsiveness.
[CONTEXT] The legal pages (Terms of Service, Privacy Policy, License Agreement) for this site already exist in the Growth OS site. The brand measurement site needs to link to them.
[PATTERN] A simple Python HTTP server (`python3 -m http.server 8081`) is a quick way to serve a static website from a directory.
[PATTERN] Use `lsof -ti:8081 2>/dev/null | xargs kill -9 2>/dev/null` to kill a process running on port 8081 before starting a new server. This prevents address already in use errors.
[DECISION] Kill existing server processes and start the server using python in background (python3 -m http.server 8081 &) before opening the brand measurement site in the browser
[DECISION] Update tasks as 'deleted' to clearly signal cancellation, including all child tasks of the parent agent.

### Checkpoint 2 (50% — Half Session) (04:34)

[GOTCHA] The "Read" tool returned a warning: "the file exists but is shorter than the provided offset (1). The file has 1 lines." This suggests the tool may be trying to read beyond the end of a short file, even when just reading the whole file.

### Checkpoint 3 (75% — Three-Quarter Session) (05:32)

[PATTERN] CSS animations can be triggered on scroll using `IntersectionObserver`, adding or removing classes to elements when they become visible (main.js, various elements with `.reveal` class).
[PATTERN] In CSS, use custom properties (`var(--my-variable)`) for theming and consistency across styles (style.css).
[PATTERN] CSS animations with staggered delays can create engaging effects for elements appearing sequentially (`.reveal-delay-1`, `.reveal-delay-2`, etc. in style.css).
[PATTERN] SVGs can be animated using CSS by manipulating properties like `stroke-dashoffset` and `opacity`, and those animations can also be scroll-triggered (style.css, main.js chart animation).
[PATTERN] "Konami code" easter eggs can be implemented with a keydown listener that tracks a sequence of key presses, triggering a function upon completion (main.js).
[PATTERN] A cursor glow effect can be achieved by creating a fixed, blurred circle that follows the mouse, but only enable it on non-touch devices (main.js, initCursorGlow()).
[PATTERN] Subtle 3D card tilt effects can be added using CSS `transform: perspective()` and `rotateX/Y()` based on mouse position within the card, again only on non-touch devices (main.js, initCardTilt()).
[CONTEXT] The current state is a mostly complete landing page with several animated elements and an interactive mascot, Carl the Camel (index.html, style.css, main.js).
[CONTEXT] The HTML structure includes sections for "Problem", "Lifecycle", "Insight", "How it Works", "The Signal", "Results", "Efficiency", and a "Team Marathon" section (index.html).
[CONTEXT] The site uses Javascript to implement scroll-based animations (reveal, chart, cascade), Carl the Camel's behavior, cursor glow, card tilt, and the Konami code easter egg (main.js).

### Checkpoint 4 (90% — Late Session) (05:38)

[PATTERN] In the CSS, multiple team cards in the .team-grid get different bob-durations and bob-delays for the camelBob animation by using `:nth-child()` selectors and setting CSS variables like `--bob-duration` and `--bob-delay` inline on the card elements. This avoids having to write nearly-identical keyframes for each.
[PATTERN] The confetti animation uses a canvas element and Javascript to simulate confetti particles.  It includes functions to resize the canvas, define confetti particle properties, and animate the particles. It also provides a `window.confetti.burst()` function to trigger the confetti effect.
[PATTERN] The Carl the Camel mascot character has different moods (neutral, curious, analyzing, excited, celebrating) controlled via Javascript. These moods affect the SVG mouth shape (using `setAttribute('d', ...)` on the SVG path), CSS classes for animations (bounce, wiggle, celebrate), and displayed speech bubbles.
[PATTERN] The Carl the Camel JavaScript uses `IntersectionObserver` to detect which sections of the page are visible and then chooses a relevant phrase to display, improving the experience.
[PATTERN] Carl the Camel speaks randomly selected "facts" about camels when clicked, using an array of strings and a counter to cycle through them.
[PATTERN] The "reveal" effect (fade-in on scroll) is implemented using an `IntersectionObserver` that adds a "visible" class to elements when they enter the viewport. The CSS uses opacity and translateY to control the animation.
[PATTERN] A desktop-only cursor glow effect is added using Javascript to create a `div` element that follows the mouse cursor. The CSS uses a radial gradient to create the glow effect. The JavaScript uses `requestAnimationFrame` for smooth animation.
[PATTERN] The site implements a Konami code easter egg. It listens for a specific sequence of key presses and triggers a celebration animation (confetti, camel animation, hero heading animation) when the code is entered.
[PATTERN] Javascript IntersectionObservers are used to trigger CSS animations. When the "Brand Value Leads" chart is within the viewport, the `chart-animated` class is added to trigger the line drawing animation. Similarly, the cascade effect is triggered when the cascade track is visible.
[PATTERN] CSS media queries adjust the `.ai-badge` element's positioning and display properties based on screen width, improving its responsiveness across different devices.
