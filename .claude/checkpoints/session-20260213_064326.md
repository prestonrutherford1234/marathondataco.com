# Session Checkpoints — 2026-02-12

### Checkpoint 1 (25% — Quarter Session) (10:59)

[PATTERN] It's useful to check `git status` BEFORE `git pull --rebase` to avoid errors when there are unstaged changes.
[PATTERN] `git diff --stat <files>` is useful to check the status of specific files (if `git status` output is noisy).
[PATTERN] Long commit messages can be created using a here-document within the `git commit -m` command: `git commit -m "$(cat <<'EOF'\nYour message here\nEOF\n)"`.
[DECISION] When `git pull --rebase` fails due to unstaged changes, it's better to investigate the changes with `git diff` before attempting to stage/commit, especially if recent commits already exist.
[PATTERN] After completing all tasks, running `git log --oneline -5` provides a concise overview of the recent commit history for verification.
[CONTEXT] Task ID `13` refers to the session-end protocol, which involves checkpointing, dumping learnings, and consolidating changes (git commit and push).
[CONTEXT] The "lint-staged could not find any staged files matching configured tasks" message after `git commit` is a benign warning, indicating that the committed changes didn't trigger any linting rules.

### Checkpoint 1 (25% — Quarter Session) (06:20)

[PATTERN] Screenshotting the viewport in Playwright can be achieved using `await page.screenshot({ path: 'filename.png', scale: 'css', type: 'png' });`. This provides a visual representation of the current state of the application.

### Final Checkpoint (Pre-Compaction) (06:41)

[PATTERN] Local HTTP server: `python3 -m http.server 8765 &` starts a simple HTTP server in the current directory, useful for testing HTML/CSS changes.
[CONTEXT] The goal is to verify the Carl the Camel mascot's toast-style speech bubble at mobile sizes. The headless browser config will take effect next session.
[DECISION] Using `curl` to verify CSS and Playwright to visually inspect the changes.
[PATTERN] Using `grep` to quickly find specific CSS rules in a file.
[GOTCHA] The assistant will switch to headless Playwright in the next session, so this is the last time it will open a browser window.
[DECISION] The assistant advised against adding Lost Pixel and playwright-lighthouse for this project due to the small team size, infrequent updates, and simplicity of the static website. The overhead wasn't justified.
